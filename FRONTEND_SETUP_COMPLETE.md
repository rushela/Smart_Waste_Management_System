# Frontend Setup Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. AppRouter.tsx
- **Removed** non-existent worker component imports (WorkerLogin, WorkerDashboard, etc.)
- **Removed** WorkerAuthProvider dependency that didn't exist
- **Simplified** router to include only existing routes
- **Kept** CollectionForm accessible at `/worker/collection`

### 2. API Configuration
- **Verified** `.env` file exists with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`
- **Fixed** TypeScript error in collections.api.ts for import.meta.env access

## Available Routes

### Public Routes
- `/` - Home page
- `/login` - User login
- `/signup` - User signup

### Payment Routes
- `/payment` - Payment dashboard
- `/checkout` - Payment checkout
- `/transactions` - Transaction history
- `/payment/status/:id` - Payment status

### Worker Routes
- `/worker/collection` - **Waste Collection Form** âœ¨ (NEW)

### Admin Routes (Protected)
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/waste-reports` - Waste reports
- `/admin/user-reports` - User reports
- `/admin/payment-reports` - Payment reports
- `/admin/custom-reports` - Custom reports

## Testing the Collection Form

### 1. Start MongoDB (if not running)
```bash
docker start mongodb
# OR if container doesn't exist:
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
Expected output: `Server running on port 5000` and `MongoDB connected`

### 3. Start Frontend Dev Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Expected output: `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

### 4. Navigate to Collection Form
Open browser: `http://localhost:5173/worker/collection`

## Collection Form Features

### Bin Scanning
- Click **"Scan QR Code"** - Simulates QR scanner (uses prompt dialog)
- Or toggle **"Manual Entry"** to type bin ID directly
- Bin IDs are automatically converted to uppercase (e.g., `bin001` â†’ `BIN001`)

### Resident Information Panel
Displays after successful bin scan:
- Resident name, address, email, phone
- Current star points balance
- Current outstanding payment balance
- Bin status and last collection date

### Collection Form Fields
1. **Waste Type** (required)
   - Recyclable
   - Non-Recyclable

2. **Weight** (required)
   - Numeric input in kg
   - Must be positive number

3. **Notes** (optional)
   - Additional comments about the collection

### Reward Calculation Preview
Shows estimated rewards based on waste type and weight:
- **Recyclable**: +10 star points per kg, $0.00 payment
- **Non-Recyclable**: 0 star points, $5.00 per kg payment

### Submit Options
Three buttons based on collection status:
1. **Submit Collection** - Full collection completed
2. **Submit as Partial** - Partial collection
3. **Submit as Not Collected** - Bin was not collected

### After Submission
- Success message with collection ID
- Automatic form reset
- Ready to scan next bin

## API Endpoints Used

### GET /api/collections/bins/:binID
Fetches bin details and resident information

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bin": {
      "_id": "...",
      "binID": "BIN001",
      "status": "pending",
      "lastCollection": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    "resident": {
      "_id": "...",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "555-0100",
      "starPoints": 150,
      "outstandingBalance": 25.50
    }
  }
}
```

### POST /api/collections
Creates a new collection record

**Request:**
```json
{
  "binID": "BIN001",
  "wasteType": "recyclable",
  "weight": 5.5,
  "status": "collected",
  "notes": "All recyclables collected"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "...",
    "binID": "BIN001",
    "resident": "...",
    "dateCollected": "2024-01-20T14:30:00.000Z",
    "wasteType": "recyclable",
    "weight": 5.5,
    "starPointsAwarded": 55,
    "payment": 0,
    "status": "collected",
    "notes": "All recyclables collected"
  }
}
```

## Testing with Existing Data

Your database already has seeded data:
- 5 residents
- 10 bins (BIN001 through BIN010)
- 30 collection records

Try scanning these bin IDs:
- `BIN001`
- `BIN002`
- `BIN003`
- etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "Network Error" or API not responding
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Check MongoDB is running
- Verify `.env` file has `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`

### "Bin not found"
- Make sure you're using uppercase bin IDs (BIN001, not bin001)
- Check bin exists in database: `db.bins.find()` in MongoDB

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run dev` - Vite will show any compilation errors
- All current TypeScript errors have been resolved

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Add More Worker Features
Create additional worker pages if needed:
- Worker login/authentication
- Collection history view
- Worker dashboard with statistics
- Manual entry for bins without QR codes

### Enhance Collection Form
- Add photo upload for waste verification
- Add GPS location tracking
- Add offline support with local storage
- Add barcode scanner integration

### Add Real QR Scanner
Replace the simulated scanner with a real QR code library:
```bash
npm install react-qr-reader
```
