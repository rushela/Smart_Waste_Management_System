# ✅ ALL 404 ERRORS FIXED - Complete Summary

## What Was Wrong

Your application had **404 errors on multiple API endpoints** because the backend routes were not mounted in `index.js`:

### Failed Endpoints
```
❌ /api/payments/*          - Payment routes not mounted
❌ /api/pricing/*           - Pricing routes not mounted  
❌ /api/reports/summary     - Reports routes not mounted
❌ /api/reports/trends      - Reports routes not mounted
❌ /api/reports/payments    - Reports routes not mounted
❌ /api/users/*             - Users routes not mounted
```

## What Was Fixed

### Complete Route Configuration
Updated `backend/index.js` to mount **ALL** API routes:

```javascript
// Import and mount all API routes
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');
const paymentRoutes = require('./routes/payments');
const pricingRoutes = require('./routes/pricing');
const reportsRoutes = require('./routes/reports');
const usersRoutes = require('./routes/users');

app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/payments', paymentRoutes);
app.use('/api/pricing', pricingRoutes);
app.use('/api/reports', reportsRoutes);      // ← THIS WAS MISSING!
app.use('/api/users', usersRoutes);
```
