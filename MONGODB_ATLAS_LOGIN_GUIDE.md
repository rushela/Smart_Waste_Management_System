# Setup MongoDB Atlas & Login Guide

## Issue: IP Address Not Whitelisted

Your MongoDB Atlas cluster is blocking the connection because your IP address is not whitelisted.

## Solution 1: Whitelist Your IP Address (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to MongoDB Atlas
1. Open browser and go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Login to your account

### Step 2: Whitelist Your IP
1. Click on **"Network Access"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Add IP Address"** button
3. Choose one of these options:
   - **Option A (Easy):** Click **"Add Current IP Address"** - Whitelists your current IP
   - **Option B (Open):** Click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** - Enter `0.0.0.0/0` (less secure, but good for testing)
4. Click **"Confirm"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to take effect

### Step 3: Run Seed Script Again
```bash
cd backend
node seed/seedAllData.js
```

## Solution 2: Create Users via Signup Page (Alternative)

If you don't want to configure MongoDB Atlas right now, you can create test accounts directly through the web interface:

### Step 1: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
