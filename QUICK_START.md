# Quick Start Guide

## Running the Application

### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend will start on: http://localhost:5000

You should see:
```
Backend dev server listening on http://localhost:5000
Connected to MongoDB
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on: http://localhost:5173

You should see:
```
VITE v5.4.20 ready in XXXms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

## That's It! ðŸš€

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5173

## Available Commands

### Backend
```bash
npm start     # Start the server
npm run dev   # Start with nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
npm test      # Run tests
```

### Frontend
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 5000 is already in use":
```bash
# Stop all node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Then restart
cd backend
npm start
```

### MongoDB Connection Warning
You might see a MongoDB connection warning. This is normal if the database hostname is unreachable. The app will still work for development.
