- Data is now managed through the application UI

### ✅ Simplified Startup
- Backend runs with simple: `npm start`
- No need to run seed scripts
- Everything configured properly

## How to Run the Application

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

✅ Output should show:
```
Backend dev server listening on http://localhost:5000
Connected to MongoDB
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend (in another terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

✅ Output should show:
```
VITE v5.4.20 ready in XXXms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:5173

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000

# Kill node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Restart
cd backend
npm start
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5173 is in use
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173

# Clear node_modules if needed
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force
npm install
npm run dev
```

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Verify MONGO_URI in `.env` is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes your IP

### API 404 Errors
- All routes should be mounted (already done)
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for actual error messages

2. Create more pricing models for different cities
3. Test all CRUD operations
4. Explore reports and analytics
