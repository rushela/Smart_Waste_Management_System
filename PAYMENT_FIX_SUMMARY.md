# Payment System Fix Summary

## Problem
The payment data was not appearing in the payment history page. Users received:
- `400 Bad Request` errors when accessing `/api/payments/summary`
- `400 Bad Request` errors when accessing `/api/payments/history/me`
- Payments were created but not shown in the history

## Root Causes

### 1. Authentication Mismatch
- Frontend was using a hardcoded `x-user-id` header
- When users logged in, they received JWT tokens stored in `localStorage`
- The payment API wasn't using these JWT tokens, causing user mismatch

### 2. Missing User Filter in Summary Endpoint
- `/api/payments/summary` was aggregating ALL payments across all users
- It didn't filter by the current user's ID
- This caused 400 errors when no valid user context existed

### 3. Incomplete authHeader Middleware
- The `authHeader` middleware only checked for `x-user-id` header
- It didn't support JWT token authentication
- Payment routes couldn't work with logged-in users

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Frontend API Client (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
```typescript
// Added request interceptor
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (token) {
    // Use JWT token if user is logged in
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  } else {
    // Fallback to dev user ID
    config.headers['x-user-id'] = DEV_USER_ID;
  }
  return config;
});
```

**Why**: Ensures authenticated users send their JWT token with every API request.

### 2. Enhanced authHeader Middleware (`backend/middleware/authHeader.js`)
```javascript
// Now supports both JWT and x-user-id
async function authHeader(req, res, next) {
  // Try JWT token first
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (token) {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    const user = await User.findById(decoded.id);
    if (user) {
      req.user = { id: user._id.toString(), ... };
      return next();
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback to x-user-id for dev mode
  if (req.header('x-user-id')) {
    req.user = { id: req.header('x-user-id') };
    return next();
  }
  
  return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
}
```

**Why**: Allows payment endpoints to work with both authenticated users (JWT) and dev mode (x-user-id).

### 3. Fixed Payment Summary Controller (`backend/controllers/paymentController.js`)
```javascript
exports.summary = async (req, res) => {
  const userId = asObjectId(req.user?.id);
  if (!userId) {
    return res.json({ totals: [], outstanding: 0 });
  }
  
  // Filter by current user
  const match = { userId };
  
  const totals = await PaymentRecord.aggregate([
    { $match: match },
    { $group: { _id: '$type', total: { $sum: '$amount' } } }
  ]);
  
  // ... rest of aggregation
};
```

**Why**: Ensures summary only shows data for the current user, not all users.

### 4. Reordered Payment Routes (`backend/routes/payments.js`)
- Moved `/summary` route before generic `/:id` route
- Applied `authHeader` middleware to all routes
- Ensured proper route precedence

**Why**: Prevents route conflicts and ensures authentication runs on all endpoints.

### 5. Updated Login & Register Pages
- `Login.tsx`: Now uses `AuthContext.login()` to authenticate and store JWT
- `Signup.tsx`: Now uses `AuthContext.register()` to create account and auto-login
- Both pages properly redirect based on user role

**Why**: Users get JWT tokens upon login/registration which are used for all API calls.

### 6. Updated Navigation Bar (`frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
- Added "Report Issue" button for authenticated users
- Added conditional "Manage Issues" button for staff/admin
- Shows user profile link and logout button when logged in
- Uses `useAuth()` hook to check authentication state

**Why**: Provides clear visual feedback of login state and quick access to new features.

## How the Payment Flow Works Now

### 1. User Registration/Login
```
User → RegisterPage/LoginPage
  ↓
AuthContext.register()/login()
  ↓
Backend /api/auth/register or /api/auth/login
  ↓
JWT token + user data returned
  ↓
Stored in localStorage
  ↓
User redirected to dashboard
```

### 2. Creating a Payment
```
User clicks "Pay Now"
  ↓
Frontend sends POST /api/payments
  + Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
  ↓
authHeader middleware extracts user from JWT
  ↓
paymentController.createPayment() creates PaymentRecord
  + userId from JWT
  ↓
Payment saved to database
  ↓
Success response
```

### 3. Viewing Payment History
```
PaymentsPage loads
  ↓
Calls GET /api/payments/history/me
  + Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
  ↓
authHeader extracts userId from JWT
  ↓
Controller filters PaymentRecord by userId
  ↓
Returns user's payment history
  ↓
Displayed in table
```

### 4. Viewing Summary
```
PaymentsPage loads
  ↓
Calls GET /api/payments/summary
  + Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
  ↓
authHeader extracts userId from JWT
  ↓
Controller aggregates PaymentRecords for that user
  ↓
Returns totals and outstanding balance
  ↓
Displayed in stats cards
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: All payment operations now require proper authentication
2. **Data Isolation**: Users can only see their own payment data
3. **Session Persistence**: JWT tokens allow users to stay logged in
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for auth failures
5. **Dev Mode**: Still supports x-user-id header for testing without login
6. **User Experience**: Clear navigation with auth-aware UI

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow end-to-end
2. Add payment receipt generation
3. Add email notifications for payments
4. Implement payment reminders
5. Add payment analytics dashboard
6. Set up automated testing for payment flows
